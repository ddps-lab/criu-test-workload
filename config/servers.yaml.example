# Server Configuration Example
# =============================
# Copy this file to servers.yaml and edit the IP addresses for your environment

nodes:
  ssh_user: "ubuntu"
  ssh_key: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"

  source:
    # Source node where workload runs and checkpoint is taken
    ip: "10.0.1.10"       # Edit: your source node IP
    name: "az-a-node-0"

  destination:
    # Destination node where workload is restored
    ip: "10.0.1.11"       # Edit: your destination node IP
    name: "az-c-node-0"


# AWS Lab environment example:
# After running terraform in aws-lab/, copy the IPs from output
#
# nodes:
#   ssh_user: "ubuntu"
#   ssh_key: "~/.ssh/aws-spot-test-key"
#   source:
#     ip: "10.0.1.123"    # az_a_instances output
#     name: "az-a-node"
#   destination:
#     ip: "10.0.3.45"     # az_c_instances output
#     name: "az-c-node"
